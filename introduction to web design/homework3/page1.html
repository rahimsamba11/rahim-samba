	<h1>ULTRAS LIFESTYLE</h1>
	<p>Ultras are a type of association football fans who are renowned for their fanatical support. The term originated in Italy but it is used worldwide to describe predominantly organised fans of association football teams. The behavioural tendency of ultras groups includes their use of flares (primarily in tifo choreography), vocal support in large groups and the displaying of banners at football stadiums, all of which are designed to create an atmosphere which encourages their own team and intimidates the opposing players and their supporters. The frequent use of elaborate displays in stadiums is also common.</p>

	<p>The police knocked on the door, and they took my grandfather away. Four months later, he came home with a head full of lice. <br> C'est tout. "He never wanted to talk about it," my dad says.

My dad likes to talk about things, to pass down stories as if they <br> were family heirlooms. There is the family dog, a German Shepherd mutt, shot by French paratroopers. The former student <br>who warned my great-grandfather he was on the French hit list and that my great-grandfather could no longer be protected. <br>The wife who did not know her husband was also in the FLN and, fearing he might rat her out, threatened him with a knife. <br> What colour was the knife, I wonder? Was it serrated or dull? <br>Was it used to chop onions when it was not clenched in a woman's fist?</p>
