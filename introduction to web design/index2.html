           <h2>AMAZIGH (BERBER) FLAG</h2>
           <p> In 1998, the World Amazigh Congress made the flag official at Tafira on Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, which were formerly inhabited by the Guanches, an ancient Berber people. The flag is composed of blue, green, and yellow horizontal bands of the same height, and a Tifinagh letter yaz or aza.</p>

           <h2>Berber flag meaning </h2>
           <p> Each color corresponds to an aspect of Tamazgha, the territory inhabited by the Berbers in North Africa: 
            Blue represents the sea.
            Green represents the Tell and the north of Tamazgha.
            Yellow represents the vastness of the desert.
            The red of the letter Z (ⵣ in Tifinagh) represents the freedom of the Imazighen.
            The Berber flag thus symbolizes the entire Amazigh people, living in harmony with their land, Tamazgha.</p>

        <h2> Additional Information</h2>
        <p>The Berber flag (Berber language: Akenyal Amaziɣ, ⴰⴾⴻⵏⵢⴰⵍ ⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵗ) is a flag that has been adopted by many Berber populations including protestors, cultural and political activists. It is currently used by Berber political and cultural activists and organizations in 10 African countries, namely: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Egypt and the Canary Islands.

            The flag was inaugurated in Wadya, a town of Kabylia situated in Tizi Wezzu, a province of Algeria, by an elder Algerian Kabylian. <br> The Berber flag, seen  in Agadir, symbolises peace and Amazigh unity. While there has been much talk of the Arab spring, ethnic Berbers have played a key role in the changes sweeping through North Africa, which is leading to greater recognition for their culture and language. <br> We are called Amazigh, plural Imazighen, a word which means “free people” in the Indigenous Tamazight language. ... Among outsiders, the more common – though incorrect – name for Imazighen is Berber, a term that is largely rejected by Imazighen for its negative connotations. <br> Amazigh tattoo designs are extremely symbolic and are believed to induce fertility, to cure illnesses, and to protect against spirits or jnoun. Much of the time, Amazigh tattoos are placed near the eyes, mouth, and nose traditionally placed on women.</p>
